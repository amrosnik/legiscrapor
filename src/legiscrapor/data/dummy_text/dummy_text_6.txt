Work in Cross-Platform Applications

I am not a huge fan of web-based tools and applications. Between potential security issues, vendor lock-in, and years of living with flaky internet connections, I'm most comfortable working locally and then syncing. I end up using mainly desktop applications and letting NextCloud handle the rest. This way I can keep working even when the coffee shop Wi-Fi craps out. And I never have to worry that an update to my favorite cloud application will destroy my entire workflow.

For all of this to work, though, it helps to use applications that are cross-platform. For Windows, macOS, and even Linux, this is mostly not a problem. For spreadsheets and all things office-suite related, I use LibreOffice, which works across all three. Vivaldi and Firefox for web browsing work on all of these operating systems, as do communications apps like Zoom and Slack.

Problems crop up if you start to consider Google's Chrome OS, which barely has the concept of a desktop, let alone locally running applications. This is why we suggest you very carefully evaluate your needs before buying a Chromebook. On Chrome OS, you're more or less forced to use web-based applications. If you want tight integration with the operating system itself, you're further limited to Google's web-based applications.

When I have to test Chrome OS devices, I punt and use Google's applications since this is most likely what readers will be doing and I'm trying to evaluate how well a device meets those needs. To get my data off Chrome OS so I can work on it elsewhere, I manually copy and paste from a Google Doc into a plain text document in NextCloud (which does at least sync files to Chrome OS devices via the Android app). This is awkward and I don't recommend it as a workflow, but it gets me by.
