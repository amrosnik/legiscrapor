(Basic Principles) 
Article 2 The implementation of comprehensive legal support and the establishment of a comprehensive legal support framework is to be undertaken pursuant to the following Article through Article 7, with the aim of establishing a society in which people throughout the country can get the information and services they need to have recourse to the law in resolving disputes regardless of whether it relates to a civil or criminal matter.

(Maintenance and Development of a Civil Legal Aid Program) 
Article 4 In implementing comprehensive legal support and establishing a comprehensive legal support framework, it must be undertaken to appropriately maintain and develop a civil legal aid program that makes it easier for persons of limited means and other persons who have difficulty in obtaining the services they need in order to have recourse to the law to resolve disputes to have recourse to civil, family, and administrative court proceedings (meaning court proceedings in civil cases, domestic relations cases, and administrative cases; the same applies hereinafter) and to administrative complaint filing procedures (meaning the procedures for filing complaints pursuant to the Administrative Complaint Review Act (Act No. 68 of 2014); the same applies in Article 30, paragraph (1), item (ii)), in light of the fact that such civil legal aid program is of great public interest.
